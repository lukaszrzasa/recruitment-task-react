# Task Manager

Simple TaskManager with drag&drop API and user profile with its location on the map.

[See demo hosted on Netlify.com](https://react-recruitment-task.netlify.com/)

This project was created for FullHD screen resolution. I wanted to check that I'm able to properly use drag&drop API, that I haven't used before. 

### Features

- Create & edit tasks in 5 categories
- Assign user to task
- Move task to different category & reorder categories
- The "Done" category can only contains tasks with assigned Project Manager
- Favourite tasks
- Filter tasks by content or by Assigned User
- Filter users by name or by job title
- View profile of user with basic info, assigned tasks & location on the map
